Java_Poker
==========

Poker sim built in Java.  My first Java project! The simulation deals 8 hands of cards and plays through the hand, indicating the leading hand until the river is dealt.

Press SPACE to advance the round.
Requires JDK 7.

Paths are all relative so should run OK from anywhere.

Poker.properties file is a bit flaky and can be 
consumed so there is a back up file available 
to replace it until the IO op is better protected.
