Java_Poker
==========

Poker sim built in Java.  My first Java project!

[[https://github.com/TTr2/Java_Poker_Simulation/blob/master/Java_Poker_Screenshot.jpg]]

Requires JDK 7.

Paths are all relative so should run OK from anywhere.

Poker.properties file is a bit flaky and can be 
consumed so there is a back up file available 
to replace it until the IO op is better protected.
